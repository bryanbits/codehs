# Complete CodeHS Nitro Code
###### Dedicated to Zephyr (pay attention to comments starting with "///")
My solutions (and the given code) for the CodeHS Nitro course for AP Computer Science A 

Most solutions are considered to be the "canon" solution, but there are a few that are brute forced simply out of a lack of effort, and a few that are needlessly overcomplicated due to an overabundance of time, and the fact that I had been coding in Java for 4 years prior.

Note: This code is purely for reference purposes. I do not condone code plagiarism in any way or form. I highly suggest attempting to solve the problems yourself first, and then asking for help from another human being before looking at the solution code. This repository is not meant to be a copy-paste solution bank.
